A GISt tool for Local files.

The idea originally spawned from the idea of being able to quickly create a
gist of any file on my local system. To me, the idea behind a gist is a version
controlled file where commit messages are not important.

With this tool, my entire file system can be managed by git without having git
think that every directory is a git repository.

Example:

# optional
gisl config core.worktree /path/you/want/to/track  # default: /
gisl config gisl.dir ~/.my_cool_repo.git           # default: ~/.gisl.git

# required
gisl init                                          # (re)initialize gisl

NOTE: if worktree and gisl.dir are the same, this file is pointless
set environment variables to override gisl config
export GISL_CONFIG (in your .bashrc for example) if you want to use something
other than ~/.gislconfig

To install, just clone the repo and put gisl in your $PATH
