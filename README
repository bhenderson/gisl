A GISt tool for Local files.

The idea originally spawned from the idea of being able to quickly create a
gist of any file on my local system. To me, the idea behind a gist is a version
controlled file where commit messages are not important.

With this tool, my entire file system can be managed by git without having git
think that every directory is a git repository. Nor do you have to manage
symlinks etc.

Install:

clone the repo and put `gisl' somewhere in your $PATH

NOTE: if worktree and gisl.dir are the same, this file is pointless
set environment variables to override the gisl config
export GISL_DIR (in your .bashrc for example) if you want to use something
other than ~/.gisl.git

Usage:
gisl <any-git-opts>

Example:
# add a new file to track
gisl add /path/to/file
gisl commit

# Issues
checkout to other machines is difficult
checkout files to directories where you don't have permissions is difficult
